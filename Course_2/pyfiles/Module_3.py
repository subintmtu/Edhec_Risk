# Load the 49 industries Value weighted returns and cap weights, and use the period 2013-2018 both included. For the period, use the starting cap weights of the period. Limit yourself to the following 5 industry sectors: 'Hlth', 'Fin', 'Whlsl', 'Rtail', 'Food'.
# You will need to compute the correlation matrix as well as the volatilities. (Hint: Remember to annualize the volatilities by multiplying the volatility you get from the monthly data by the sqrt iof 12)
# Using the same value of delta used in the He-Litterman paper of 2.5 and using the same sigma prior methodology used in the notebook and in the paper, compute the implied returns vector.
